# rag_pipeline
the one rag pipeline to allow anyone to chat with their documents 
What can RAG be used for?

    Customer support Q&A chat - Treat your existing customer support documents as a resource and when a customer asks a question, you could have a retrieval system, retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a "chatbot for your documentation".
    Email chain analysis - Let's say you're a large insurance company and you have chains and chains of emails of customer claims. You could use a RAG pipeline to find relevant information from those emails and then use an LLM to process that information into structured data.
    Company internal documentation chat
    Textbook Q&A - Let's say you're a nutrition student and you've got a 1200 page textbook read, you could build a RAG pipeline to go through the textbook and find relevant passages to the questions you have.

Common theme here: take your relevant documents to a query and process them with an LLM.
